ABetterMetronome
================
This is an example of a better metronome. Alot of people use NSTimer or some other mechanism that is simply not as accurate as is needed. This example counts frames to determine when the next beat should play and injects it immediately into the audio buffer. It is therefore accurate to the frame - you can't get much better than that. Use this however you please with credit as appropriate. This example makes use of TheAmazingAudioEngine by A Tasty Pixel.
